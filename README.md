# Figma to React + Tailwind Responsive Website

This project is a **personal learning implementation** where I converted a Figma design into a fully responsive website using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  

> Note: This was originally an assignment for a company, and I have improved the design, responsiveness, and UI elements for my portfolio.
